## Correcting Linter Errors Automatically

The linter can fix many errors that it highlights, including indentation.

Errors before:

Errors fixed:

![Lint Fixing after](./lint-fix-2.png)

After you have auto-fixed problems, some auto-fixable problems may still exist. Running another auto-fix pass may be needed.

**Note:**  Undo (Ctrl + Z, or Cmd + Z) undoes only a single auto-fixed line. If you are anticipating extensive changes, you may want to save your file first.
