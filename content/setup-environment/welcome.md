<font size="4"> You're probably already familiar with GitHub. Itâ€™s the world's go-to platform for collaborating on coding projects. GitHub offers a lot more than just version control though.

In this demo we'll teach you about Github Actions, the most widely used CI/CD tool for automating DevOps workflows. We'll also give you a quick introduction to Codespaces,  an instant cloud-based development environment that lets you skip the setup process and start collaborating on projects right away. You're actually in a Codespace right now.

By the end of the demo you'll understand both tools at a high-level, some key benefits, and how to start building your own GitHub Actions workflows.

Alright, let's get started. ðŸš€ </font>
