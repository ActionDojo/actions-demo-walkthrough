## Spool files

You can view the spool files from Actions that you run if you enable the 'Log Compile Output' setting.

## Enable the settings

To enable the setting, [open the VS Code Settings](command:workbench.action.openSettings) and search for 'compile output'.

Make sure the setting is enabled.

## Viewing the spool output

Click the Output tab, which shows in the windows at the bottom of VS Code. If the window is not open, you can open it with Control + J / Command + J.

The window has 4 tabs. Select the 'Output' tab and then in the dropdown to the right select 'IBM i Output'.
