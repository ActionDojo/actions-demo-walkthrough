# Running SQL statements

**For this to work, SQL must be [enabled in the settings]((command:code-for-ibmi.showAdditionalSettings)).** When you're working with SQL files it is possible to highlight an SQL statement and exeute it from within the editor.

1. Open any source member or streamfile with the `sql` extension
2. Highlight the statement you want to execute
3. Press Control + R / Command + R to execute the selected statement.

You can also do it using this method if you don't want to use an existing file:

1. Create a new file (Control + N / Command + R)
2. Change the file language to SQL (highlighted in the image)
3. Write and highlight the statement
3. Press Control + R / Command + R to execute the selected statement.
