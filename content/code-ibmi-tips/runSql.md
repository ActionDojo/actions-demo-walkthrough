## Running SQL statements

**For this to work, SQL must be [enabled in the settings]((command:code-for-ibmi.showAdditionalSettings)).**

When working with SQL files you can highlight an SQL statement and exeute it from within the editor.

### SQL in a file

1. Open any source member or streamfile with the `sql` extension
2. Highlight the statement you want to execute
3. Press Control + R / Command + R to execute the selected statement.

### Adhoc SQL

If you just want to run or test a statement, try this:

1. Create a new file (Control + N / Command + N)
2. Change the file language to SQL (highlighted in the image)
3. Write and highlight the statement
4. Press Control + R / Command + R to execute the selected statement.
