## Notebooks

Notebooks are documents that contain a mix of rich Markdown, executable code snippets, and accompanying rich output. These are all separated into distinct cells and can be interleaved in any order.

Notebooks are great storytelling devices, allowing you to interleave Markdown elements like images, math equations, and explanatory text with your code. Notebooks can be a perfect way to share and explain your ideas with coworkers or the public community.
