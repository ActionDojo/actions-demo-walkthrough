<h1>Viewing and understanding workflow runs</h1>

<h3>

1. Navigate to the "Actions" tab of your repository on GitHub. This will show a list of all the workflow runs that have been triggered for your repository.

2. Click on a specific workflow run to view its details.

3. On the workflow run page, you can view the following information:

    - Workflow: The name of the workflow that was run.
    - Event: The event that triggered the workflow (e.g. push, pull request).
    - Commit: The commit that was associated with the event.
    - Status: The status of the workflow run (e.g. success, failure).
    - Duration: The amount of time it took for the workflow to run.
    - Jobs: A list of the jobs that were run as part of the workflow, along with their status and duration.

4. To view the output of a specific job, click on the job in the list. This will show you the steps that were run as part of the job, along with their output.

5. To view the output of a specific step, click on the step in the list. This will show you the output of the step, including any log messages or error messages that were generated.

By reviewing the output of workflow runs, you can understand what actions were taken as part of the workflow, and any errors or bugs that were caught by that workflow run. This is helpful for debugging problems or for understanding the overall process of your CI/CD pipeline.
