<h1>Debugging errors with your workflow</h1>

<h3>
To debug any linting errors caught by Actions, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab of your repo on GitHub.

2. Click the latest workflow run for your linter. _You can identify the linting workflow run by its name (e.g. "Linter"), or by the message in your last commit._

3. Click the linting job to view its details. _This will show you the steps that were run as part of the job, along with their output._

4. Look for any error messages or warning messages that were generated during the linting process. These messages will provide information about the specific linting issues that were identified.

5. Once you have identified the linting issues, you can fix them by modifying your code on the file(s) and line(s) indicated by the workflow run.

6. Commit and push your code changes, and trigger a new workflow run to verify that the linting errors have been resolved.
