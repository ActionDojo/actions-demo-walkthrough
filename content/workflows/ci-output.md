<h1>Debugging errors with your workflow</h1>

<h3>

To debug any linting errors caught by Actions, you can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Actions" tab of your repository on GitHub. This will show a list of all the workflow runs that have been triggered for your repository.

2. Look for the latest workflow run for your linter. You can identify a linting job by its name (e.g. "Linter"), or by the message left in your last commit.

3. Click on the linting job to view its details. This will show you the steps that were run as part of the job, along with their output.

4. Look for any error messages or warning messages that were generated during the linting process. These messages should provide information about the specific linting issues that were identified.

5. Once you have identified the linting issues, you can fix them by modifying your code on the file(s) and line(s) specified by the workflow run.

6. Commit and push your code changes, and trigger a new workflow run to verify that the linting errors have been resolved.

If the error messages are not sufficient to understand the issue, you can try running the linting tools manually on your local machine to get more detailed output. For example, if you are using the Super Linter action, you can clone the repository and run super-linter from the command line to get more detailed output.
