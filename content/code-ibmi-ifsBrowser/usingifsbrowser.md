# Using the IFS Browser

The IFS Browser simply allows you to browser and edit streamfiles on the IFS on the connected IBM i. By default, the IBM i will show you the user profiles home directory.

It will list all files and folders, in alphabetical order, that you can browse and open. Clicking on a folder will expand it and show what files and directories exist within it. Clicking on a streamfile will open it as an exitable item.
