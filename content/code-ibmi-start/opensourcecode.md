## Opening and viewing source code

Opening source members is easy. The view called the Member Browser  is a list of source files. You will want to add your source file(s) to the list.

1. Add a source file to the Member Browser using the add button (the folder with the plus icon). When  asked for the source file, enter it in **library/srcpf** format. Examples:

   * `YOURLIB/QRPGLESRC`
   * `OTHERLIB/QDDSSRC`

2. When a source file has been added, click on it to load a list of the members in the source file.

3. Next, click on a source member to open it.
