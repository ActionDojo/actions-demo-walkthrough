## Opening and viewing source code

Opening source members is easy. There is a view called the Member Browser and inside of this view is where a list of your source files can live.

1. Start by adding a source file to the Member Browser. There is a button to do it on the view (the PLUS icon). When being asked for a path, it can take a path to the source file. For example:

   * `YOURLIB/QRPGLESRC`
   * `OTHERLIB/QDDSSRC`

2. When the source file is open, you can click on it and that will load a list of members inside of the source file.

3. Next, you can click on a source member to open it.
