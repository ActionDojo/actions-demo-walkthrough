## Compiling code

To compile code, or simply run a command, we must run it as an Action. Actions are defined ways to run a command. For example, there is an Action to run `CRTBNDRPG` for any member that has the `RPGLE` extension in the `ILE` environment.

There is another tutorial on viewing and managing Actions, but for now we can use the built in ones.

To run an Action, open up a source member (or IFS streamfile) and press:

* Windows: Control + E
* Mac: Command + E

This will show a dropdown of the available Actions for the open file. You can use the arrow keys to select which Action you'd like to run and hit enter to select it.
