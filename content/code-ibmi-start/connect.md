## Get connected

To connect to an IBM i, you need at least:

* The IP address or the hostname of the system
* Your user profile name
* Either a password or a SSH key

Code for IBM i connects to the system over SSH, so the SSH Daemon must be started on your IBM i.

After you install the Code for IBM i extension click the IBM i icon in the side bar:
