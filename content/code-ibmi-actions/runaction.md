## Running an Action

To run an Action, open up a source member (or IFS streamfile) and press:

* Windows: Control + E
* Mac: Command + E

This will show a dropdown of the available Actions for the open file. You can use the arrow keys to select which Action you'd like to run and hit enter to select it.

For example, to run the 'CRTBNDRPG' Action, you must open a source member with either `RPG` or `RPGLE` as the extension. Then, when you use the Run Action shortcut (as above), you will see the Action in the list.
