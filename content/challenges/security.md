<h1>Security Workflows</h1>

<h3>Difficulty: Moderate/Hard</h3>

- **CodeQL:** [Write a code scanning security workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-automatically) that runs a [CodeQL scan](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/) to find potential vulnerabilities in your code. _To enable CodeQL, the repo needs to be public or under an org/enterprise with a GitHub Enterprise plan for private repos._

- **Dependabot Alerts:** [Setup Dependabot alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) to tell you when your code is depending on a package that is insecure.

- **TruffleHog OSS:** [Setup security scans with TruffleHog OSS](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/trufflehog-oss) an open source secret-scanning engine that helps resolve exposed secrets in your tech stack.
