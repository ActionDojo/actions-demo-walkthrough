<h1>Continuous Deployment</h1>

<h3>Difficulty: Moderate/Hard</h3>

<h3>
In the playground we deployed your website to GitHub Pages to demonstrate CD as a concept. In real-world development though, youâ€™ll most often be deploying apps to your cloud provider.

Practice setting up automatic deployments to your cloud provider with GitHub Actions:

- [Deploy to Azure](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-to-your-cloud-provider/deploying-to-azure)

- [Deploy to Amazon ECS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-to-your-cloud-provider/deploying-to-amazon-elastic-container-service)

- [Deploy to Google Serverless Computing with GitHub Actions](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/deploying-serverless-platforms-github-actions/)
