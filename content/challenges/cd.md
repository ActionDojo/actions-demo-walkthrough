<h1>Continuous Deployment</h1>

<h3>Difficulty: Moderate/Hard</h3>

<h3>
- **Branch protection rules:** [Require status checks before code can be merged](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging)
- **Deploying with Environments:** [Create environments for your staging and deployment branches](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#deployment-branches) to safely test changes before deploying them to your live site.
- **Preview your site in PRs:** Preview your website from Pull Requests before deploying it using [this Action from the GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-pr-preview)
