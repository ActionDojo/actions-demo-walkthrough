## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

<font size="4"> Welcome to the GitHub Actions playground. In this demo I'll introduce you to GitHub Actions, the world's most popular tool for automating CI/CD workflows. Iâ€™ll also introduce you to Codespaces, which is what you're currently using to access this development environment.

By the end of the demo youâ€™ll know how to:
1. Write and run your own YAML workflows
2. Use these workflows to spot errors and ensure code quality
3. Identify some common use-cases for GitHub Actions

This demo is designed for developers learning about Actions for the first time. If youâ€™re new to Git, GitHub and version control, you'll probably want to learn about those concepts first.

At each step weâ€™ll teach you a core concept related to Actions, YAML, or CI/CD. Feel free to skip any steps if you already understand the concept. I'll also give you some optional challenges at the end of demo if you want to dive deeper into a subject.

You'll practice these core concepts by building a portfolio website and deploying it to GitHub Pages. Feel free to personalize your portfolio site to your liking and share it with the world. ðŸ™‚

Alrighty, letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€
