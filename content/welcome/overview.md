## Hey ðŸ‘‹

<font size="4"> You're probably already familiar with GitHub. Itâ€™s the world's go-to platform for collaborating on coding projects. GitHub offers a lot more than just version control though.

In this demo I'll introduce you to GitHub Actions â€“ the world's most popular tool for automating CI/CD workflows. Iâ€™ll also introduce you to Codespaces â€“ which is what you're currently using to access this development environment.

By the end youâ€™ll know how to:
1. Write and run your own YAML workflows with Actions
2. Use these workflows to spot errors and ensure code quality
3. Identify some common use-cases for GitHub Actions

This demo is designed for developers learning about Actions for the first time. If youâ€™re new to GitHub and version control, you probably want to learn about those concepts first.

At each step weâ€™ll teach you a core concept related to Actions, YAML, or CI/CD. Feel free to skip any steps if you already understand a concept. There will also be optional challenges at the end of demo if you want to dive deeper into a subject.

You'll practice these core concepts by building your own portfolio website and deploying it to GitHub Pages. When youâ€™re donem youâ€™ll have a personalized portfolio website that you can share with the world. ðŸ˜Ž

Alright, letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€
