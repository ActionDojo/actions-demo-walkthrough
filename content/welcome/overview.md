<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Actions Playground!</h1>

<h3>In this demo I'll introduce you to GitHub Actions, the most popular tool for automating CI/CD workflows. Iâ€™ll also touch on Codespaces, the tool you're currently using to access this development environment.

By the end, youâ€™ll know how to:

1. Write, run and view YAML workflows for GitHub Actions
2. Use these workflows to spot errors and ensure code quality
3. Identify some common use-cases for GitHub Actions</h3>

<h3>We'll cover the following core concepts:

1. Writing YAML syntax
2. Viewing and understanding workflow runs
3. Building Continuous Integration (CI) workflows
4. Building Continuous Deployment (CD) workflows

_Feel free to skip any steps if you already understand the concept. I'll also give you some optional challenges at the end of demo if you want to dive deeper into any of these subjects._

You'll practice by building CI/CD workflows for a portfolio website and deploying it to GitHub Pages. Feel free to personalize your portfolio and share it with the world. ðŸ™‚</h3>

<h2>Alright, letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€</h2>
