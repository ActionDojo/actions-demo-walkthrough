<h3>Welcome to the Actions Playground. In this demo I'll introduce you to GitHub Actions, the most popular tool for automating CI/CD workflows. Iâ€™ll also touch on Codespaces, the tool you're currently using to access this development environment.

By the end, youâ€™ll know how to:

1. Write and run your own YAML workflows
2. Use these workflows to spot errors and ensure code quality
3. Identify common use-cases for GitHub Actions </h3>

<h2>Core concepts</h2>
<h3>In each walkthrough, weâ€™ll teach you one of the following core concepts:

1. Writing YAML file and viewing workflow runs
2. Building Continuous Integration (CI) workflows
3. Building Continuous Deployment (CD) workflows

Feel free to skip any steps if you already understand the concept. I'll also give you some optional challenges at the end of demo if you want to dive deeper into a subject. </h3>

<h2>What you'll be building</h2>
<h3>You'll practice these core concepts by building a portfolio website and deploying it to GitHub Pages. Feel free to personalize your portfolio site to your liking and share it with the world. ðŸ™‚ 

Alright, letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€</h3>
