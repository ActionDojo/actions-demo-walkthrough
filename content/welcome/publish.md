<h1>Publish your project to GitHub</h1>

<h3>For GitHub Actions to work your project needs to be connected to a GitHub repo. Since we started from a Codespace, you'll need to publish this project to your GitHub account.

1. Click the "Source Control" button in your sidebar
2. Click the "Publish Branch" button
3. Name your repo, select "Publish to GitHub public repository", and hit "Enter"
4. Open your newly published repo and keep it open in another tab (you'll be going to this tab to view your workflow runs)

_Important: Make sure to publish the project as a “public repository” if you don’t want to use your monthly Actions minutes._</h3>

<h2>Awesome! Your project is now live in GitHub. 🎉 </h2>
