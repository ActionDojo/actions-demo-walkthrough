<h1>Publish your project to GitHub</h1>

<h3>For GitHub Actions to work your project needs to be connected to a GitHub repository.

Since we're starting from a Codespace, you'll need to publish this project to your GitHub account.

1. Click the "Source Control" button in your sidebar
2. Click the "Publish Branch" button.
3. Make sure to select "Publish to GitHub public repository" (Important! If you publish as a private repo, you'll be drawing from your account's Actions minutes)
4. Name your repository and hit "Enter".</h3>
