<h1>Setup Process</h1>

<h3>In a typical project the first step is to setup your development environment, install the necessary dependencies and libraries, and maybe run a few scripts. This setup can often take a few hours... if not days.

Thanks to Codespaces, your development environment has already been setup for you! You can jump in and start coding right away.</h3>
