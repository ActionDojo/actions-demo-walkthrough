<h1>Common Questions</h1>

<h2>What is Codespaces?</h2>
<h3>GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that lets you write, run, and debug code right in your browser. You can easily set up a development project and onboard new contributors to a project in seconds... rather than hours or days.</h3>

<h2>What is GitHub Actions?</h2>
<h3>GitHub Actions is a tool for automating, customizing, and executing software development workflows right within your repository. It allows developers to create "actions", small units of code that can perform tasks such as building and testing code, publishing packages, and deploying code to production. Workflows can be triggered by a variety of events, including pushes to the repository, pull requests, or the creation of new issues.</h3>
