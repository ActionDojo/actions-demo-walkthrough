# Actions Demo Walkthrough

This VS Code extension is for testing and building the VS Code walkthrough extension for the Actions Playground MVP. It'll have the most up-to-date content for task list in the Actions Playground.

Current state: The rough draft workflow steps are all there (Simple workflow, CI and CD) â€“ CD will need more editing to actually work

Remaining work:
- [ ] Add instructions for deploying to GitHub Pages (CD)
- [ ] Add a final step to the "Workflows" walkthrough for the demo completion step
- [ ] Add a walkthrough for "Optional Challenges"

To test the plugin:
1. Open the repo in Codespaces
2. Click the "Run and Debug" icon in the sidebar

Once the extension is ready, we'll need to export it as a package (vsix file) to be uploaded into the demo repository

Notes to eng:
- This was forked an IBM extension so it'll have a lot of unneccessary remnant code. We should recreate this extension repo from scratch.
- Keep the "package.json" file and the "/content" folder. Everything else can be scrapped.
