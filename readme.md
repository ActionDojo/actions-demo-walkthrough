# Actions Demo Walkthrough

This VS Code extension is for testing and building the Actions Playground (MVP) walkthroughs. It'll have the most up-to-date content for the Actions Playground demo.

Current state: The rough draft workflow steps are all there (Simple workflow, CI and CD) â€“ they will need some editing to actually work

Remaining work:
- [ ] Add a final step to the "Workflows" walkthrough signifiying the demo completion
- [ ] Add a walkthrough for "Optional Challenges"

To test the plugin:
1. Open the repo in a Codespace
2. Click the "Run and Debug" icon in the sidebar

Once the extension is complete, we'll need to export it as a package (vsix file) to be uploaded into the demo repository

Note: This was forked an IBM extension so it'll have a lot of unneccessary remnant code. We should recreate the extension repo from scratch.
Keep: The key files are the "package.json" file, and all of the ".md" and ".png" files in the /content folder.
